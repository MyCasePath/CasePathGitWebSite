    <h1>From Foster Parents to Transforming Case Management</h1>
    <p id="aboutP1">
      In 2014, Tyson Wilke and his wife, Kim, became foster adoptive parents.  Through this experience it revealed the heartbreaking flaws in existing child welfare and Mental Health systems.
      <br>
      <br>
      In 2019, they founded RE Services to help families facing CPS interventions, only to find that traditional tools like Kareo, Google Drive, and Salesforce couldn’t handle the interconnected demands of human case management.
      <br><br>
      Motivated by first hand struggles and fueled by compassion, Tyson built CasePath—a dedicated platform designed to bring real-time insights, accountability, and hope to families, agencies, and the social services community at large.
